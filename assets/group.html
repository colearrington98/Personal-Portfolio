        <p>Shared lunch is a web application designed to help solve the issue of food waste. The goal was the to create
            a
            way for resteraunts, grocery stores and other food establishments to communicate with chartitable donation
            centers like food pantries and homeless shelters to give any extra food.</p>
        <p>My role in the group was engineering the backend and making sure everything was communicating with one
            another. I
            created a MySQL database to seed and store all the data. We created a login feature so that the food
            establishment could make an account and sign in.</p>
        <p>For future development we are working on adding more features like enabling the food pantries and shelter
            being
            able to create accounts and login. </p>

            alt="ride or die">
        <p>Ride or die is an app designed for occasional or frequent travelers to plan a fun bike day in a new city.
            Once the user inserts their desired location, the app will respond with the weather for the next 5 days and
            bike rentals in the area. We also preseented the user with safety tips for staying visible while riding at
            night or in the rain.</p>
        <p>My role was finding a bike rental app and implementing it into the app using Javascript. Since the bike API
            is communicating with weather API, I had to make sure the parameters were similar.</p>
        <p>For future development we want to implement a better API and possibly a better weather API. We also want to
            add more features to make it more user friendly.</p>
