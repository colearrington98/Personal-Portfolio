    <p>Shared lunch is a web application designed to help solve the issue of food waste. The goal was the to create a
        way for resteraunts, grocery stores and other food establishments to communicate with chartitable donation
        centers like food pantries and homeless shelters to give any extra food.</p>
    <p>My role in the group was engineering the backend and making sure everything was communicating with one another. I
        created a MySQL database to seed and store all the data. We created a login feature so that the food
        establishment could make an account and sign in.</p>
    <p>For future development we are working on adding more features like enabling the food pantries and shelter being
        able to create accounts and login. </p>

    <p>Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and Handlebars</p>
